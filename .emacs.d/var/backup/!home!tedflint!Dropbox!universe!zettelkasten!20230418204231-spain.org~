* March 2023

We travelled to Vitoria-Gasteiz and Burgos in March 2023, to visit Kenny and to attend Dan and Elena's wedding blessing and the baptism of Alejandra.

The actual ceremonies were on Saturday 25 March in a little village called Villahoz.  Then we called in at a pretty and ancient town called Lerma where Gillian spent E39 at the Instituto Iesu Communio, Avenida San Pedro Regalado, to buy biscuits and truffles from nuns!

We went on to a wonderful reception in a country restaurant.

In the evening we walked into Burgos and had an uproarious evening partying in the streets, tapas bars and clubs with Elena's family.
