#+title: top-level-interests
Here is an attempt that I have made (in April 2023) to classify my interests.

The first set of interests are those that I have in common with pretty much everybody else.  I call these interests
[[id:81be6613-0bb9-40d9-8c5e-5b3bc480f646][universal-interests]].  They include my health and fitness, my relationships with family and friends, personal administration, and caring for our home and garden, and engagement in our community.

The second set of interests are my [[id:5ba98000-a570-4267-82ab-bbf0e2a737ae][creative-interests]].  These include art, craft and music.

The third set of my interests are my investigative-interests.  These include nature, technology, science, history and culture.

A further set of interests you could call my [[id:72ded64d-baf2-4c06-bc67-739b4a38181c][recreational-interests]], and this would include [[id:bea854c7-b809-4a2c-80ef-aa1d496ddeee][travel]], reading, watching film, television and theatre, and listening to podcasts and music.

Finally, for the moment, there is something that I will call [[id:96c64625-4539-4375-9e85-f48601effee7][personal-history]].

I am sure that there are others that I haven't captured yet but I can always add them.
