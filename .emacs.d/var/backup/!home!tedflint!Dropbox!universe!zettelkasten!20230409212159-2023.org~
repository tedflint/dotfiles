We started the year in Florence.

On 11 January I attended the 160th meeting of the [[id:55d8169e-ca5b-42ea-aea0-3a1a4241d6fc][RSTL]], travelling up to London by train (£74.30 from Tisbury).

On 29 January I went to Homebase and spent £21 on a universal bracket ( for a child's bicycle) and four white London shelf brackets for Janet Budgen's garage.
