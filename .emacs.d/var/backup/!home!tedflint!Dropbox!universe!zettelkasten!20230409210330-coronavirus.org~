We had our first vaccination at Bruton Community Hall at around ten o'clock on Monday 1 March 2021.  Afterwards we went for a pastry at the Old Chapel Bakery.

We had our second dose at the same place at around two o'clock in the afternoon on Monday 17 May 2021.

We subsequently had a booster in (Norton St Phillip?) and Shepton Mallet.

Neither of us caught the virus until Gillian tested positive on 9 December 2022, shortly after we got back from visiting our families in Stockport and Altrincham.  She had a mild case and was well and testing clear by the time of our [[id:1075ed5a-9673-4ffb-bb32-690b9e3d5089][Christmas 2022 visit to Florence]].
