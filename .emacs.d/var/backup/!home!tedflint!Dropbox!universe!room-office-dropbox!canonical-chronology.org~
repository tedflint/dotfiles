Mungo Melvin advised us, in his introduction to the course at the Royal College of Defence Studies, to get writing early.  Indeed, he encouraged us to adopt his practice of writing 1,500 words each day.  Since he has already completed and published a book about Manstein, he seems well qualified to give advice on this subject.  Compounded with this is some similar advice from a very different source.  Leo Babauta is the author of the Zen Habits and "mnmlist" blogs.  A Hawaiian living now in San Francisco, he is an advocate of the simple life.  He wrote earlier this week about his morning habits, which are to sit, to read and to write.  It doesn't matter what you write, he says, so long as you write.  Mungo's view is that, in developing your ideas about your dissertation early, by writing you will find that your thoughts crystallize readily and naturally.

These separate yet consistent pieces of advice struck a chord with me, and are also resonant with the idea of continuous improvement through small daily steps, which I find convincing and attractive.  So for a week or so now it has been my intention to start a daily writing habit.  An idea like this carries with it some excitement, but also a small anxiety.  Will this be yet another false start?  Another idea or new habit that starts with excitement but peters out only to be forgotten.  Sometimes such anxiety is enough to slowly strangle the idea at birth.  There is another idea, however, that is an antidote, or perhaps it is really two ideas.  The first is that of the "persistent starter", which acknowledges that attempts often fail, but if you have sufficient persistence then you are bound, in the end, to succeed, so long as you keep starting again.  The second is simply that there is nothing to be lost by trying, and even a few days of writing will carry some value.

The course at the Royal College of Defence Studies is intended to give us a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of contemporary issues in international relations, and develop our powers of strategic analysis and leadership.   Two weeks into the course, I feel that my understanding is certainly improving, and I have certainly been exposed to a large number of ideas, some of which I can remember.  They fall into broadly two categories: ideas about how to think strategically, and ideas about international relations.

It has been emphasised to us, particularly by Charles Style and by Mungo, that thinking strategically is a different matter from thinking at what we in the military would call the operational or tactical levels.  It demands a different outlook, a different set of skills, and perhaps even a different kind of brain.  The contours of this new kind of thinking are only slowly emerging for us, but the key features seem to be: a tolerance of ambiguity; an acceptance of the complexity of the real world and therefore an ability to resist the urge to simplify; and an ability to see things from a number of widely different perspectives.  This appeals to me.

The other thinking skills might be described as ways of taking an issue apart in order better to understand it.  To someone with an Army education, they look just like checklists, but they might more accurately be described as a way to force you to adopt a number of different perspectives from which to view something.  The first that we hav been introduced to is PESTLE-C.  The acronym stands for "political, economic, social, technical, legal, environmental and cultural".  The second is known as the "instruments of power":  diplomacy, information, military and economic power.  Then there is the idea of "levels".  The world can be understood at the level of the individual, the level of the state, or the level of the system of states.

The early speakers on the course have been interesting to listen to, but not all of them have come up with ideas that stick in the mind.  I would find it hard to pick any new insights out of Nick Harvey's or Andrew Mitchell's talks. Between them they made a claim that Britain would continue to act on the world stage as a force for good, closing down ungoverned spaces in which terrorism breeds; and they spoke about the importance of the comprehensive approach and the coordination of activities across different Government departments.  As Government Ministers, however, they were clearly working off carefully written scripts and even during the discussion periods they gave little away (beyond the fact that Andrew Mitchell gratuitously offended our Pakistani members by describing their country as a "failing if not failed state".

We have heard from Sir Adam Roberts, Lord Douglas Hurd, Professor Christopher Coker, Professor Ian Clark and Dr Nigel Bowles.  We have had two seminars - one with Dr Warren Chin and another with Mungo Melvin.  We have learned about polarity - asking ourselves whether this is a unipolar, multi-polar or non-polar world, and which model is the most stable.  We have considered the role of the United States, and whether or not it is a hegemon, and whether or not its power is waning.   And we have begun to think about whether the "realist" model is adequate to explain the complexity of the behaviour of states and their people.

Many important Americans are realists - especially the neoconservatives.  Their analysis is based on the assumption that the single driving force in the behaviour of states is the need for security, and that this drives competition between states that results in "internal" behaviour - investment in military capability - and "external behaviour" - the formation of alliances or military action with the objective of weakening enemies or otherwise promoting security.

This is not an analysis to which many liberals seem to subscribe, and I think that the liberal view is closer to mine than the realist view.  Critics of the realist view claim that the world is more complex, indeed that it is simply not susceptible to any explanation based on a single factor such as security.  Moreover, they reject the idea that every state is purely driven by the desire to provide security from external threats.  Some states focus, for instance, on maximizing the wealth of their people, or on their welfare, or on some other measure of well-being.  In democracires, the behaviour of states, including the decision whether to take internal or external action to improve security, is constrained by the need to secure the support of the domestic electorate.  Many states behave as if they were part of a "society of states", with a set of values and norms that go beyond security concerns.

Another idea that we have considered is that of globalization - is it good, is it bad or even is it a useful idea?  My own view is that there are two rather different and separate aspects to globalization.  The first is the capability that technology has provided (and continues to provide) to move information, people, goods and services between states and across the world.  The second is the liberalization of trade policies.  In combination, these have resulted in a huge increase in cross-border trade, migration, and cultural cross-fertilization (or contamination).

So how does this add up to something that attracts violent and passionate demonstrations at international economic summits?  Part of the explanation lies in the symbolic nature of these meetings of the finance ministers of the world's richest countries.  But there is also a narrative that goes like this:  the rich Western states, and in particular the United States, have created an international economic system that serves their needs at the expense of the world's poorest states.  Those in third world countries who do benefit are those who hold power, and those who suffer are the poorest and most powerless.  They are induced - by the actions of the market - to move away from self-sufficiency based on the crops that grow best on their land to dependency on cash crops that are both destructive to the local environment and subject to significant price instability.  All too often the consequence is ecological damage combined with a catastrophic fall in prices.  Famine and death are often the inevitable consequence. I am interested in understanding to what extent this is true, and I look forward to next week's exploration of economics which might shed some light on the subject.

The last thing that sticks in my mind is a paper that criticizes the conventional approach to development and sets out an alternative model.  This suggests that we should adopt a different definition of poverty.  Instead of measuring poverty in economic terms, we should consider other aspects of the richness of life, placing particular emphasis on people's ability to provide for themselves and their families.  Development that takes the form of hand-outs is at best neutral or at worst destructive of this kind of quality of life.  However, this is overwhelmingly the form that much Western aid currently takes.   I look forward to probing this as well.

**** 7 October 2010 Thursday Corps Guest Night - my dining out 
**** 8 October 2010: 2214

I am still tired from last night's Corps Guest Night, having stayed up until about half past three in the morning.  I skipped RCDS today, and Gillian rang the college to tell them that I had missed the train, while I slept in until lunchtime.  I had a pretty bad hangover, but I guess that I deserved it.

I really enjoyed the dinner, and the Master made a very flattering speech before presenting me with a sword and Corps cycling colours.  I sat between Tim Inshaw and Andy Start, and had a really good chat with each of them.  Later in the evening I had a long conversation with Stuart Brown, our Corps artist and agreed to meet up with Charles Hughes in London.

After I got up I had a long bath and read from a book about the principal management gurus, which is interesting.  Warren Bennis's ideas stick in my mind.  He summarises the key abilities of a manager as managing attention, managing meaning, managing trust and managing yourself.  Managing attention is about setting a vision while managing meaning is about communicating that vision to your employees.  Managing trust is self-explanatory, while self-management has a number of adspects:  commitment, willingness to take risks, knowledge and self-knowledge.

I sat for a while in the garden, in the sunshine, reading the management gurus book and taking some notes.  Then I went into school with Will, who had an appointment with Mr Johnson to discuss his university application.  While I was waiting, I thought up a thinking exercise.  The basic notion is to examine a concept from a number of different perspectives, and then to allow the resulting thoughts to go where they will.

The exercise goes like this.  Take the concept, and try to define it as clearly as possible.  Then consider it in its most exaggerated or extreme form.  Then think about its opposite.  Come up with some adjectives to describe the concept.  Then think of synonyms and closely related concepts.  Then think of metaphors and similes.  See whether you can think of any analogies.  Try to work out the etymology and think of the meaning of any other words that spring from the same root, including any other parts of speech such as nouns, verbs and adjectives.

This is a summary of the exercise:

1.   Definition
2.   Extreme
3.   Opposite
4.   Adjectives
5.   Synonyms
6.   Related ideas
7.   Metaphors and similes
8.   Analogies
9.   Etymology
10. Words from the same root
11. Other parts of speech

Here is an example, based around the concept of "vision".   Definition: an idea of a possible and perhaps a desirable future.  A hallucination could be regarded as an extreme vision.  "Lack of vision" could be considered to be an opposite to vision.  Kinds of vision: a compelling vision, a dark vision, a vivid vision, a detailed vision, a beautiful vision, an optimistic vision and a pessimistic vision Synonyms and related ideas include: dream, hope, fantasy, blueprint, design, goal and objective.  Visions are concerned with possibilities, while forecasts and predictions are concerned with probabilities.  I can't think of any metaphors or similies - when you say "a vision of loveliness" this is, I believe, a different sense of the word "vision".  Nor can I readily think of an analogy.  The word "vision" comes from the latin verb to see.  Other words from the same root include "video", "revise" and possibly "envisage".  Other parts of speech: visionary, envision.

Time for bed!
**** 9 October 2010: 1525

I am thinking about how to think, and surfing the web to see what other people have come up with.

ED BOYDEN ON THINKING

Here is a list of ten points by an assistant professor in the MIT Media Lab called Ed Boyden.

1.	Synthesize new ideas constantly.  Never read passively.  Annotate, model, think,  and synthesize while you read.

He claims that if you do this you will always "aim towards understanding things at a resolution fine enough for you to be creative".  Now, while I like the idea of coming up with new ideas, and I also like the idea of reading actively, I don't think that I really see a direct  link between the two.  Perhaps what he is driving at is that you should not only try to identify ideas as you read, and to capture them, but also to process them in some way - to question, combine or extend them.

2.	Learn how to learn (rapidly).  Be able to prototype ideas rapidly.  Understand how your brain works.

3.	Work backwards from your goal.

4.	Always have a long term plan.  The act of planning is worthwhile even if the plan changes every day.

5.	Make contingency maps.  Draw a map of all of the things that you need to do on a piece of paper, showing which things depend on other things.  Then do first the things that have the most things dependent on them.

6.	Collaborate.

7.	Make your mistakes quickly.

8.	As you learn, write up your best practice protocols.  Instinctualize conscious control.

9.	Document everything obsessively.  Much of creativity is learning how to see things properly.  Most profound discoveries are a surprise, but unless you document your observations and learn how to trust your eyes, you will never notice when something is a surprise.

10.	Keep it simple.  If you can find a way to make something simpler then it is likely to fail less often and to work better.  And learn, if only to know what has failed before.  Remember the old saying "six months in the laboratory can save you an afternoon in the library".

He also recommends logarithmic time planning and composing conversation summaries - written or drawn - during conversations.  He gives the original to the person with whom he was talking, having taken a digital photograph to upload to his laptop for storage and indexing.

ROGER DARLINGTON ON CRITICAL THINKING.

Here are some more thoughts from Roger Darlington, who describes himself as portfolio worker, with a background in the trades unions associated with the communications industry.

He starts with a lovely quotation from Bertrand Russell:  "Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man."

Thinking critically means asking questions rather than accepting information at face value.  To understand an event - such as a news item, ask three questions:  what is the explanation? What is the history? And what does this mean for the future?  (To summarize, think about explanation, history and anticipation).

Sources are important.  You should use multiple sources, you should use primary sources where you can, and you should check your sources.  When using a source you should check its date, and find out about its author, funder and publisher.

Critical thinking includes an examination of assumptions and, especially in respect of surveys and polls, consideration of the way in which information was collected, in terms of sample size and composition, sampling bias, questions asked, and so on.

You should probe any proposition by looking for exceptions and counter-examples as well as the supporting evidence.  If the evidence requires it, you should be prepared to change your mind.  You should not just be open to alternative explanations, you should seek them.   Be careful of the assumptions that you make, and understand on which assumptions the validity of your proposition depends.

Resist jumping to conclusions, and think critically about every step of the argument.  Remember the power of Occam's Razor, and think carefully about the simplest possible explanation.  Be careful to distinguish "cause and effect" from "common cause" or coincidence, and understand which way causality is operating.  Understand the potential for the observer to change a situation.

Translate and manipulate statistics to get a better understanding of what they mean, turning percentages into absolutes and vice versa.  Carefully examine probabilities and look for false reasoning, particularly where a priori and a posteriori could be wrongly used.

Challenge authority, received wisdom and groupthink.  Beware of anecdotes.  Trust your instincts.

Deconstruct any work into its elements:  separate the argument from the evidence, the structure and the presentation.  With a novel, separate the plot from the characterization and the language.  With a film, separate the script, the acting, the direction, the cinematography and the music.

Think about what is missing, what is not there?  Expand the context and think out of the box.  Think the unthinkable.  Think like your competitor or your opponent.

Test your ideas on other people.

Practice critical thinking all the time.  Keep on practicing it, even though it might hurt!  Don't worry if it initially confuses you.  And remember that the fundamental question is always "why?".

JOE LANDSBERGER ON CREATIVE THINKING

Rethink!  Look at problems in  many different ways, and find new perspectives that nobody else has taken.

Visualize!  Use diagrams and imagery, pictures, images, graphs or mindmaps.

Produce!  Constantly apply thoughts and tools to arrive at a solution.  Be patient and persistent.

Combine!  Make novel combinations.  Combine and recombine ideas, images and thoughts into novel combinations no matter how incongruent or unusual.

Form!  Form relationships.  Make connections between dissimilar subjects.  Form relationships with people and ask them questions.  Get to know the people in your field that can help you.

Opposites!  Think in opposites.  Don't always get stuck with the obvious solutions.  Move outside your comfort zone.

Metaphors and similes!  Think metaphorically.

Fail!  Learn from your failures.  Failures create opportunities for  high value learning that cannot be gained through successes.

Be patient.  Apply your ideas with patience for the benefits that they might bring.

WIKIHOW ON THINKING LIKE A GENIUS

Become a knowledge glutton.  Read, listen, observe and remember.

When you learn something you know, try to apply it and connect it to something else you know, especially something that you have recently have learned.

Understand Bloom's Taxonomy:  knowledge, application, comprehension, analysis, synthesis, evaluation.

Learn how you learn: seeing, hearing, talking, listening, touching, manipulating, reading, interpreting ideas, writing, doodling, talking out loud.

Embrace uncertainty, change and doubt.

Be prolific. Try for quantity rather than quality.  To produce exceptionally good work, do a lot of whatever you are doing.

Think "different".

SOME OTHER IDEAS

Prepare yourself for chance.  Regard a failure as a creative accident.  Analyze the process, its components and how you can change tham to arrive at other results.  Do not ask yourself "why have I failed?" but rather "what have I accidentally done?".

Be curious, playful, imaginative, creative, wondering, wise, inventive, vital, sensitive, funny and joyful.

Generate ideas in pictures rather than in words.

Allow your thinking to be unconstrained - throw nothing away.

Treat thoughts as things.

Keep your thinking focused (I am not sure about this).

Be passionate and determined about discovery.

See potential in everything.

Never give up.

Look at the whole system:  the problem and everything associated with it.

EDWARD DE BONO'S THINKING HATS SYSTEM

Imagine a shelf full of hats, each of a different colour.  When you put on a particular hat, your brain changes and it thinks in a particular way.

When you put on the white hat, you think only in terms of facts and information.

When you put on the red hat, your emotions come to the fore.

When you put on the black hat, you are full of doubt and think critically about the negative aspects of any issue; you are quick to notice mismatch and inconsistency.

When you put on the yellow hat, you are full of hope and optimism, and readily see benefits and harmony.

The green hat enables you to go beyond logical and critical thinking, giving you the freedom to investigate innovative and creative ideas, following thoughts wherever they will take you

The blue hat is for thinking about thinking.   It is the first and the last hat that you put on, to plan your thinking and then to reflect and evaluate at the end.

The hats can be worn in any order, but (wearing the blue hat) you should aim to wear each of the hats in turn in a planned sequence depending on what sort of thinking you are trying to do.

MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALY ON THE SUBJECT OF FLOW

Finally, on a related but slightly different line of thought, Mihaly Csikszentmihaly has developed the idea of flow.  Flow will arise when you have clear goals, a high degree of concentration, direct and immediate feedback, a close balance between ability level and challenge, a sense of personal control over the activity, and an activity that is intrinsically rewarding.  Under a combination of some or all of these conditions, you are likely to lose any self-conciousness, as action and awareness merge; you will also lose awareness of the passage of time and of bodily needs.  The name "flow" is associated with the idea of being carried along by a water current.

****  10 October 2010: 1107

I have really enjoyed my reading yesterday and today, and it has given me some food for thought.  I shall just jot down some insights for digestion later on:

You can use your intelligence to spot patterns of activity and behaviour that others cannot see.  If you combine these insights with an idea of the possibilities of a situation then you will find yourself in a position of relative power.

If you have no fear then you have access to a wider range of possibilities.

Your culture has a strong effect on the way that you experience things and behave.  An understanding of people's family and cultural backgrounds will help you to understand them.

One reason why things go wrong is fatigue and the stress that can be induced by a combination of individually insignificant things.

Major accidents or failures tend to have many causes which have a cumulative effect.  They are also often the result of a breakdown in team work.

Team work can break down because of a culture of deference to one's superiors.  This can be so powerful as to cause major plane crashes when a copilot or engineer  fails to pass critical information to the chief pilot effectively because he is using "mitigating language".

************************************************************************************************PLANS
************************************************************************************************


Turning to today:  there are several things that are on my mind, and some time today (three o'clock) I shall go to the station to pick up Hattie.  On my mind:  revision for my mathematics exam on Thursday, selection of my dissertation subject, my Defence Career Partnership, the Alanbrooke Society and the maintenance issues at the Keep.  In addition there are some smaller tasks.  I should talk to Dad and Mum on the phone, and write a thank you letter to Tim and the Master for my farewell as Signal Officer in Chief.

My plan for maths revision is to go through the answers to the specimen paper and the TMAs and highlight or annotate the Course Glossary with anything that is needed to answer the questions.  Since the Course Glossary is at Foreshore, I will do most of this on Monday and Wednesday afternoons.

My plan for selecting my dissertation subject is to have a look at Seaford House papers today and to come up with a dozen possible titles.

My plan for the Defence Career Partnership is to research the major firms in the ISTAR supply chain and narrow down to six.  Tomorrow I shall try to get an interview or at least a phone call with Sir Kevin O'Donohue, and also ring Sally Coulthard.

My plan for the Alanbrooke is to collate the proposed names into a list, to thank those who have submitted names personally, and to send the list out to the course membership asking for feedback and telling them about 26th October.

My plan for the keep is to email the people who are having problems to see whether they have been fixed, and to try to found out who controls ASAs.

I have two books on the go: Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell and Carol Kennedy's Guide to the Management Gurus.  I see that Carol Kennedy has also written a book called "The Next Big Idea" that I might order from the library.

I feel like I have plenty of time today and no pressure.  I really enjoyed "Dorsai!" by Gordon Dickson and I shall probably read another of his books next.  I find him thought provoking and, in a way, inspiring.

In terms of administration, I could do with emptying my email in-tray and my paper in-box today.  I think that I shall do them both in chunks.

Some more ideas:  an effective creative system has got to be able to handle surprises: failures that turn out to be successful for another purpose.

I have found another couple of sources of information about ISTAR and industry, which I need to follow up.  The first is the UK Defence Statistics Factsheet, and the second is the evidence provided to the House of Commons Defence Committee on ISTAR.

I need to check dates for the Commandant's dinner and for the next jam session with     Gillian.  I also need to put the information together for my US visa, and plan my travel to the OU exam on Thursday.

************************************************************************************************
From the General Dynamics evidence to the Committee, here are some of the issues and ideas associated with ISTAR:
************************************************************************************************
Agusta Westland

Air Traffic Control.

ASTOR

Babcock

BAe Systems

Boeing

BT

CAE

Cap Gemini

Cobham.  Air traffic control manufacturers.

Collection.  The gathering of data to support the answering of questions.

Collection assets, which include humans and technological capabilities.  Options include aircraft, satellites, submarines, ground platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles and people.

Command and control nodes, such as armoured fighting vehicles, tactical land headquarters, sea-based command centres for amphibious forces and air platforms such as helicopters.

The command and control process.

Communications and data networks.

DABINETT is the programme that will address ISTAR capability gaps by delivering an enterprise-wide system of systems, with associated process change across all lines of development, and with the required capability and interoperability with other government departments and allies.

Direction.  The management of resources and processes to deliver actionable information and intelligence to decision makers.

Dissemination.  The delivery of the derived actionable information and intelligence to appropriate decision makers and end users.

EADS

EDS

Finmeccanica

Fleet Support

Fujitsu

General Dynamics UK.  Contractors for the Modular Exploitation Capability Technology Demonstrator Programme.


I2. Actionable information and intelligence.

IBM

Integration.   The following are examples of integration facilities: the Joint Networks Integration Body, the Joint Systems Integration Body and the EDGE, owned and operated by General Dynamics.

The intelligence cycle: direct, collect, process and disseminate.

The interoperability problem.  There is limited interoperability between systems, hindering  operational integration, flexibility and operational effectiveness. Platforms, enabling systems and communications networks are typically not procured together and so are not designed to talk to each other.  A significant amount of architectural analysis, design and testing is therefore required.  The ISTAR Engineering Programme Organisation has been created in order to oversee these activities.

ISTAR Issues:  unmanageable volumes of data, to the extent that much information that is collected remains unanalysed.  Lack of adequate communications infrastructure to pass the results of analysis to those who need it.  Processing timelines do not meet operational needs; the right information, if it is delivered late, is of little or no use.  Lack of support for resource and task management, so that analysis work can be efficiently shared between operators.  A limited range of exploitation tools: not all systms will allow users to see the same format: for instance ASTOR can read Ground Moving Target Data (GTMI), but cannot look at all forms of electro-oprical imagery.

ISTAR Engineering Programme Organisation (ISEPO)

KBR

LISTENER was a programme that was intended to automate data sharing between airborne EW collector platforms in order to ensure the timely identification and tracking of fleeting high value targets.  It was cancelled in a planning round.

Lockheed Martin

Logica

Marshall of Cambridge

Modular Exploitation Capability Technology Demonstrator Programme.  Completed in 2006, this was a demonstrator to show how individual ISTAR legacy systems could be brought together into a integrated exploitation system of systems.  A capability to do this will be sought in the early tranches of DABINETT.

Northrop Grumman

Priority needs:  improved interoperability between systems; enhanced resource management, analysis and information management tools are required in order to increase operational efficiency and capability.

Processing.  The analysis and exploitation of collected sensor data to support answering questions.

Qinetiq

Raptor.

Raytheon Systems Limited

Rolls-Royce Group

Roxel

Selex Communications

Selex SAS

Serco

Smiths

Thales

Ultra Electronics

Unmanned aerial vehicles can offer enhanced persistence and are particularly suitable for "dull, dangerous and dirty" operations.

VT Group

Watchkeeper.

**** 24 October 2010

I have got enough of everthing that I will ever need to be happy, but I still think and act as if I have not.

Would I be any happier if I were richer, cleverer, more knowledgeable, or more senior at work?

I might be happier if I were slimmer and fitter.  And I might be happier if I understood myself better.  And I suppose that I might be happier if I spent more time on less purposeful behaviour.

But actually I am more or less as happy as I ever expect to be, and that is happy enough.

So my thought for today is:  stop when you have had enough!

The personal tax allowance is £8,105 and the higher rate tax band starts at £34,370, so adding these two together we get £42,475.

My pension will be £32,222 per year initially.  It will go up to £35,350 in 2015 and £47,155 (uprated for inflation) in 2025.  My pension lump sum and early departure payment lump sum are both £141,465.

I will get £8,105 every year that is free of tax, and £24,117 will be subject to 20% tax, which is £4,823 leaving £19,294. Add back the £8,105 and you get £27,398.60.  I don't have to pay National Insurance on my early departure payments.

I will also have £10,253 remaining that I can draw in dividends.  Gillian will be able to draw £8,105 in salary and £34,370.

Together we could take £52,728 out of the company before paying any tax on dividends or salary.

The company would have to make a profit of £65,910 to generate dividends or salary at this level.

Supposing I managed to 100 days of work every year at £1000 per day.  Thus the value of the company would grow at £34,000 per year.

**** 9 April 2012

I have just got up and let the dogs out.  It is 0853.  Dad and Bernard are already up and Bernard has brought me a cup of tea.  We had a lovely day yesterday, full of laughter.  I ate far too much - but that was my plan.  At one stage Dad got the giggles about the toaster pockets that Gillian had given him.  He doesn't have a toaster.  Gillian also got the giggles at the table.  I can't remember what brought them on.

Some things I need to do:  book my hotel, Skype Beki, send my bio to Bruce Wynn, clear my emails, pack some boxes.

I must eat less today than I have done so far this weekend.

I shall print out my to-do list and consistently keep it in a prominent place.

I need to find my phone.

1812 Let's try this by identifying the first eight asterisms visible here and now
1811 Asteroid 21446 is known as Tedflint (1998 HV18)
1816 The brightest stars: 1 Sirius, [Canopus], [Arcturus], [Rigel Kentaurus], 2 Vega, 3 Rigel
1818 4 Procyon, [Betelgeuse], [Achernar], [Agena], 5 Capella A, 6 Altair, 7 Aldebaran, [Capella B]
1819 [Spica], [Antares], 8 Pollux
1824 This would give us: 1 Canis Major, 2 Lyra, 3 Orion, 4 Canis Minor, 5 Auriga,
1835 6 Aquila, 7 Taurus, 8 Gemini, 9 Cygnus, 10 Ursa Major, 11 Perseus, 12 Ursa Minor
1839 13 Aries, 14 Cetus, 15 Andromeda, 16 Cassiopeia, 17 Draco
1851 Canis Major has not yet risen, so I will start with Lyra
1851 Lyra: the asterism is in two parts: a parallelogram to the left and a triangle to the right
1852 The parallelogram joins the triangle at a hinge: Zeta Lyrae (a double star) magnitude 4.3
1853 The leftmost star in the parallelogram is Sulafat, magnitude 3.2
1855 The top star in the parallelogram is Delta Lyrae, magnitude 4.2, 900 LY
1856 The bottom star in the parallelogram is Sheliak, magnitude 3.5, 880 LY

Today is the last Monday that I shall ever work!  Because of the long
weekends that I have in the diary, all the remaining Mondays until the
end of May will be days off.

There is a lot of blossom in the garden: particularly wisteria, the apple trees,
the tree by the river with the fat ball feeder, the pear tree, the
orange geums, and the forget-me-nots.
